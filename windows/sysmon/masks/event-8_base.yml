description: 'The **CreateRemoteThread** event detects when a process creates a thread
  in another process. This technique is used by malware to inject code and hide in
  other processes. The event indicates the source and target process. It gives information
  on the code that will be run in the new thread: StartAddress, StartModule and StartFunction.
  Note that StartModule and StartFunction fields are inferred, they might be empty
  if the starting address is outside loaded modules or known exported functions.'
